## Why

[DeepSeek Harness](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh) is a great
harness, but it assumes it runs on your laptop: every session shares your
operating system, so you have to watch what the agents do, keep the machine
awake, and live with the scale of one machine. DSH Yawn splits dsh in two: the
harness itself runs on a server you keep on, and everything the agent does runs
in a sandbox of its own. Hence the name: you can lay back and yawn :)

|                                               | dsh on your laptop          | DSH Yawn                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dsh itself (Web UI, sessions, model calls)    | your laptop                 | an always-on server: a VM or a Kubernetes cluster                                 |
| The agent's work (shell commands, file edits) | your laptop                 | a sandbox per session: a Docker container, a Kubernetes pod, or a Buildkite build |
| Where you open it                             | that laptop                 | any browser, after signing in                                                     |
| Many sessions at once                         | share one OS, CPU, and disk | one sandbox each, on your VM, cluster, or Buildkite agents                        |
| Starting on a repository                      | your local checkout         | paste a URL; the sandbox clones it and runs `.agents/setup`                       |
| Secrets                                       | your shell environment      | a store on the server, pushed to a sandbox before commands                        |

## What's in the distribution

- Control-plane and runner images, released and tested together, and a Helm
  chart.
- dsh's Web UI, with its file, shell, and search tools running in the session's
  sandbox.
- Sandbox backends: Docker, Kubernetes
  [agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) with warm
  pools, and Buildkite.
- Sign-in with a built-in passcode, or OIDC through the identity provider you
  configure in the Helm chart.
- Web UI pages for sandbox profiles and idle timers, secrets, AGENTS.md
  instructions, notifications, MCP servers, and plugins, applied without a
  restart.
- In every session: a Sandbox tab, a file browser, and a terminal.
- Previews: a dev server in a sandbox gets its own URL.

## Requirements

- An always-on place for the control plane: a VM with Docker, or a Kubernetes
  cluster through the Helm chart.
- The ability to expose it under a domain name, on the internet or your LAN.
- Somewhere to run sandboxes: Docker on the same VM, a Kubernetes cluster with
  [agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox), or a
  Buildkite organization.
- Sign-in for the Web UI: a passcode, or OIDC with your identity provider.
- A model API key, added in the Web UI.
- Optional: a `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or Git credentials for another host, for private
  repositories and pushes.

Setup: [`docs/installations.md`](docs/installations.md).

## Quick start

This runs the control plane in Docker and starts each session's sandbox as a
sibling container: the whole install on one machine. The same shape works on a
VM.

```sh
export DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE="$(openssl rand -base64 18)"
printf 'passcode: %s\n' "$DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE"

docker run -d --name dsh-yawn \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -p 8081:8081 \
  -e DSH_YAWN_BIND_ALL=1 \
  -e DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE \
  -v dsh-yawn-data:/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-control-plane
```

1. Open <http://localhost:3000/> and enter the passcode printed above.
2. **Settings → Sandboxes → New profile**: `name: standard`, `backend: docker`.
3. Add a model credential in the Web UI settings.
4. Send a message in the **Scratch** workspace, whose sessions start in an
   empty sandbox, or use **New session → Add workspace…** with a repository URL.

To clean up: `docker rm -f dsh-yawn`. What each flag does is in the
[FAQ](docs/faq.md#what-does-the-quick-start-command-do).
