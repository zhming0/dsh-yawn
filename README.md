## Why

[DeepSeek Harness](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh) is a great
harness, but it assumes it runs on your laptop: every session shares your
operating system, so you have to watch what the agents do, keep the machine
awake, and live with the scale of one machine. DSH Yawn splits dsh in two: the
harness itself runs on a server you keep on, and everything the agent does runs
in a sandbox of its own. Hence the name: you can lay back and yawn :)

| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dsh itself (Web UI, sessions, model calls)    | your laptop                 | an always-on server: a VM or a Kubernetes cluster                                 |
| The agent's work (shell commands, file edits) | your laptop                 | a sandbox per session: a Docker container, a Kubernetes pod, or a Buildkite build |
| Where you open it                             | that laptop                 | any browser, after signing in                                                     |
| Many sessions at once                         | share one OS, CPU, and disk | one sandbox each, on your VM, cluster, or Buildkite agents                        |
| Starting on a repository                      | your local checkout         | paste a URL; the sandbox clones it and runs `.agents/setup`                       |
| Secrets                                       | your shell environment      | a store on the server, pushed to a sandbox before commands                        |

## What's in the distribution

- Control-plane and runner images, released and tested together, and a Helm
  chart.
- dsh's Web UI, with its file, shell, and search tools running in the session's
  sandbox.
- Sandbox backends: Docker, Kubernetes
  [agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox) with warm
  pools, and Buildkite.
- Sign-in through oauth2-proxy and your OIDC identity provider, in the Helm
  chart.
- Web UI pages for sandbox profiles and idle timers, secrets, AGENTS.md
  instructions, notifications, MCP servers, and plugins, applied without a
  restart.
- In every session: a Sandbox tab, a file browser, and a terminal.
- Previews: a dev server in a sandbox gets its own URL.

## Requirements

- An always-on place for the control plane: a VM with Docker, or a Kubernetes
  cluster through the Helm chart.
- The ability to expose it under a domain name, on the internet or your LAN.
- Somewhere to run sandboxes: Docker on the same VM, a Kubernetes cluster with
  [agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox), or a
  Buildkite organization.
- Sign-in in front of the Web UI. The Helm chart runs oauth2-proxy against your
  OIDC provider; on a VM, bring your own.
- A model API key, added in the Web UI.
- Optional: a `GITHUB_TOKEN` for private repositories and pushes.

Setup: [`docs/installations.md`](docs/installations.md).

## Quick start

This runs the control plane in Docker and starts each session's sandbox as a
sibling container: the whole install on one machine. The same shape works on a
VM.

```sh
docker run -d --name dsh-yawn \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 -p 8081:8081 \
  -e DSH_YAWN_BIND_ALL=1 \
  -e DSH_YAWN_CONTROL_PLANE_LAUNCH_TOKEN_ROUTE=1 \
  -v dsh-yawn-data:/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-control-plane
```

1. Open <http://localhost:3000/launch-token>.
2. **Settings → Sandboxes → New profile**: `name: standard`, `backend: docker`.
3. Add a model credential in the Web UI settings.
4. Send a message in the **Scratch** workspace, whose sessions start in an
   empty sandbox, or use **New session → Add workspace…** with a repository URL.

To clean up: `docker rm -f dsh-yawn`. What each flag does is in the
[FAQ](docs/faq.md#what-does-the-quick-start-command-do).
