# End-to-end testing

Use this guide to validate the boundaries that unit tests cannot cover: the
control plane talking to a real runner, lifecycle behavior in Docker and
Kubernetes, and a model driving sandbox tools through the dsh Web UI.

Run the smallest applicable layer while developing, then run every layer
affected by the change before opening a pull request.

## Prerequisites

Install the repository toolchain and dependencies:

```sh
mise install
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

The Kubernetes tests additionally need Docker, `kind`, `kubectl`, and Python 3. The scripts install the repository's pinned agent-sandbox version into a
disposable kind cluster. A full browser test needs a real model credential;
never put its value in a repository, command transcript, fixture, or manifest.

## Automated checks

Run these from the repository root:

```sh
pnpm check
pnpm format:check
pnpm test
pnpm build

(cd runner && go test -race ./... && go vet ./... && go build ./...)
```

Run them sequentially. The build produces `control-plane/dist`, which the Docker
smoke test imports.

When changing `proto/`, regenerate both clients and ensure the generated files
are current:

```sh
pnpm proto:generate
git diff --exit-code -- control-plane/src/gen runner/gen
```

## Docker lifecycle smoke test

Build the runner image and control plane, then run the smoke test:

```sh
docker buildx bake dev --load
pnpm build
pnpm test:docker
```

Set `DSH_YAWN_RUNNER_IMAGE` to test another local image tag:

```sh
DSH_YAWN_RUNNER_IMAGE=my-runner:test pnpm test:docker
```

The test creates a temporary registration token, tunnel server, and container,
then verifies:

1. the runner registers with the control plane and its health check succeeds over
   the reversed HTTP/2 tunnel;
2. secrets reach commands, and the runner's bundled tools are installed,
   including Python, Node.js, jq, yq, and the Docker client without its daemon;
3. `.agents/setup` runs exactly once (marked in `.git/.agents-setup-done`), and
   `.agents/resume` runs on wake;
4. hibernate/wake reconnects the runner and preserves its setup marker,
   workspace files, home-directory files, and mise-managed tools.

Success ends with:

```text
PASS: Docker runner registration, tools, setup, and hibernate/wake
```

The script removes its container and temporary control-plane state in a `finally`
block. If an interrupted run leaves a container behind, inspect it before
removing it so the failure evidence is not lost.

## Kubernetes transport and lifecycle test

Build both development images and run the self-contained test:

```sh
docker buildx bake dev control-plane-dev --load
pnpm test:kas
```

The test creates the disposable `dsh-kas-e2e` kind cluster and installs the
pinned agent-sandbox controllers. It loads the development images and runs the
production `TunnelServer` and `KasBackend` from the control-plane image as a Kubernetes
Job. Real warm runner pods dial that Job through the same in-cluster Service
and registration-token path used by the supported deployment.

The transport probe verifies:

1. `KasBackend` claims a real warm Sandbox;
2. its runner registers and answers an identity-checked health RPC;
3. secret injection, command streaming, and file RPCs cross the tunnel;
4. commands receive `DOCKER_HOST` and `docker version` reaches the rootless
   daemon sidecar over the shared socket;
5. hibernate/wake recreates the runner connection and preserves workspace and
   home-directory data.

It then runs the controller lifecycle smoke test, which additionally verifies
sub-second warm adoption, backing-pod identity, a `docker run` from the runner
container that reads the workspace through the sidecar's mount, PVC survival
across suspend/resume, the daemon answering again after resume, and foreground
expiry of a claim, Sandbox, and PVC.

Success ends with:

```text
PASS: Kubernetes runner registration, RPC, reconnect, and hibernate/wake
PASS: agent-sandbox warm adoption, suspend/resume persistence, and expiry
PASS: Kubernetes agent-sandbox transport and lifecycle
```

The command prints Kubernetes objects, pod descriptions, and available logs on
failure, then removes the cluster. To preserve it for further investigation:

```sh
KEEP_KAS_CLUSTER=1 pnpm test:kas
```

Remove a preserved test cluster with:

```sh
scripts/kas/teardown.sh --name dsh-kas-e2e
```

Set `DSH_YAWN_KAS_CLUSTER_NAME`, `DSH_YAWN_RUNNER_IMAGE`, or `DSH_YAWN_CONTROL_PLANE_IMAGE` to use
non-default names or image tags.

## Browser and model acceptance test

Run this manual test for changes to dsh integration, tool routing, workspace
setup, credentials, the control-plane image, or Web UI contributions. Create the
inspectable development cluster using the commands in
[`kubernetes.md`](kubernetes.md), rather than `pnpm test:kas`, which removes
its cluster when it finishes.

### Start a real session

1. Supply the model credential to the control plane through the model provider's
   supported host configuration. Do not add it to Kubernetes YAML or the
   repository.
2. Forward the dsh server from the control-plane pod:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn port-forward deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane 3000:3000
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000/launch-token`, which redirects to the tokenized
   URL when the control plane runs with `DSH_YAWN_CONTROL_PLANE_LAUNCH_TOKEN_ROUTE=1` (the oauth2-proxy
   patch sets it). Otherwise read the token from the control plane log and open it
   through the port-forward. Then choose the configured model, select **New
   session**, and add a disposable public repository as a Workspace:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn logs deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane | grep 'dsh web:'
   # prints http://127.0.0.1:3000/?token=…; open http://localhost:3000/?token=…
   ```

4. Ask the model to use its shell and file tools to:
   - print `uname -a` and the working directory;
   - read a known file from the repository;
   - write a uniquely named file with known content and read it back;
   - run a Docker container that bind-mounts the repository and writes a
     second uniquely named file into it, for example
     `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" alpine sh -c 'echo <content> > /src/<file>'`.
5. Find the claimed Sandbox and verify both files independently in its runner
   container, and confirm the daemon ran the container:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn get sandboxclaims,sandboxes,pods
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn exec <pod> -c runner -- \
     cat /workspace/repository/<file>
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn exec <pod> -c docker -- docker images
   ```

The model's command hostname must be the Sandbox pod rather than the control plane,
and the independently read files must contain the expected text. The file the
container wrote must be owned by UID 1000 in the runner (rootless Docker maps
container root to the sidecar's user). A chat answer alone is not evidence
that the tool ran in the sandbox.

If the control plane Deployment restarts, restart `kubectl port-forward`; it targets a
specific pod and does not follow the replacement. The browser cookie survives
the restart; only a new browser needs the new token from the log.

### Verify UI-managed instructions

Run this scenario for changes to the Instructions page or model-context
injection:

1. Open **Settings → Instructions** and save a distinctive Global instruction.
2. Select the test Workspace and save a different workspace instruction.
3. Switch between both scopes and confirm their values remain independent.
4. Close and reopen Settings and confirm both values persisted.
5. Send a new model request and verify its behavior reflects both layers, with
   the workspace instruction taking precedence where they conflict.
6. Empty each scope and save to clean up.

The settings must persist outside the repository checkout. Confirm the test did
not create or modify an `AGENTS.md` file in the Workspace.

### Verify sandbox profile selection

Run this scenario for changes to profiles, provisioning, or the composer chip.
It works against a Docker host too: give the `sandbox-manager` row two Docker
profiles that differ only by name, for example `standard` and `large` both with
`image: dsh-yawn-runner:dev`.

1. Start a new session and confirm the profile chip is visible in the
   composer's tool row and shows the default profile. It must be absent when
   only one profile is configured.
2. Pick the other profile and reload the page; the chip must still show it.
3. Send a prompt that uses the shell. Before that prompt there must be no
   sandbox for the session (`docker ps` or `kubectl get sandboxclaims`); after
   it there must be exactly one, and `stateDir/sessions.json` must record the
   picked profile on the session, with no entry left in `pendingProfiles`.
4. Confirm the chip is now disabled and keeps showing the picked profile.

### Verify sandbox web previews

Run this scenario for changes to the preview listener, the relay, or the
Web Preview tab. It works against a Docker host: give the `sandbox-manager` row a
`preview.domain` (any name — nothing resolves it, the listener routes by the
`Host` header alone) and read the preview port from the host's port bindings
(the `preview.port` setting, default 8082).

The tab builds the frame's URL from its own page and the preview host, with no
port — in a deployment one front door serves the UI and previews on the same
scheme and port — so on a development host the browser reaches the preview
listener only at the port that URL implies. Either bind the listener there
(`preview.port: 80`, which needs the privilege to bind it) or point the browser
at the real port, for example by launching Chrome with
`--host-resolver-rules='MAP *.localhost 127.0.0.1:8082'` for the default. The
`curl` step below names the port itself and works either way.

1. Start a session and ask the model to start a web server in the sandbox on
   a fixed port, detached. The Sandbox tab must list the port under
   "Listening ports" once it is up.
2. The Web Preview tab must offer the port as a chip and load the page. Typing a
   path the page does not link (plus a query string) and pressing Enter must
   load it; the port and path survive leaving and re-entering the tab.
3. The page must be functional as a real origin: absolute-path assets load,
   and `localStorage` works from the page's own console.
4. **Open** must load the page in its own tab, served from the same origin as
   the frame.
5. From the host, both of these must hold:

   ```sh
   # the preview host returns the same page
   curl -H "Host: <sandboxId>-p<port>.<preview.domain>" http://127.0.0.1:<preview.port>/
   # a host the domain does not own is unknown, not a dial
   curl -H "Host: other.example.com" http://127.0.0.1:<preview.port>/
   ```

   The first returns 200, the second 404, and a sandbox with no runner
   (hibernate it) answers 503 with the wake hint.

6. With `preview.domain` removed from the row, the Web Preview tab must say
   previews are not configured instead of disappearing.
7. Leave the Web Preview tab open past the idle delay on a page that keeps
   requesting something (it polls, or reload it by hand): the sandbox must not
   hibernate while those requests keep arriving. Stop the traffic and it
   hibernates after the idle delay — a page that loaded once and then sat idle
   makes no further requests and does not hold the sandbox open.

In a browser, `<anything>.localhost` resolves to loopback in Chrome and
Firefox, so a `preview.domain` of `preview.localhost` gives the frame a real
host name with no DNS or certificate on a development host; the host mapping
above then supplies the port.

For UI changes, record the browser state or capture a screenshot when useful,
but also exercise the interaction and verify the resulting state. A screenshot
alone does not prove persistence or model-context injection.

### Verify Web plugin management

Run this scenario for changes to the Plugins page, the bundle patch, or
`dsh-yawn-seed`.

1. The sidebar's **Plugins** page must list the official bundles the
   installation ships switched off, the official plugins that carry a
   configuration page, and `@zhming0/dsh-yawn` under **Installed**, switched
   on.
2. Pack a package that declares a bundle patch (`dsh.bundle.patch` naming a
   `cordis.patch.yml`) and install it with **Add plugin** by absolute path,
   then **Enable now**. The page must list it switched on, and the profile
   manifest on the control plane volume must gain the dependency and the
   bundle entry:

   ```sh
   kubectl -n dsh-yawn exec deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane -c control-plane -- \
     cat /data/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json
   ```

3. Roll the control plane onto a new image version (for a development build,
   remove the version marker first, as the troubleshooting note below says).
   After the restart the plugin must still be installed and switched on: this
   is the `dsh-yawn-seed` carry-forward.
4. Uninstall the test plugin from its page. The dependency and the bundle
   entry must be gone, and a restart must come up without it.

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker smoke imports fail:** run `pnpm build`; the script imports
  `control-plane/dist`.
- **A development image does not reflect the checkout:** rebuild with
  `docker buildx bake dev control-plane-dev --load`, then rerun `dev-cluster.sh` with
  `--load-runner-image`.
- **A rebuilt control-plane image still runs the old bundle:** `dsh-yawn-seed`
  refreshes the profile on the control plane volume only when the image version
  changes, and every development build is `0.0.0-dev`. Remove the marker and
  restart; the next boot merges the image's manifest fields into the profile
  and runs `pnpm update @zhming0/dsh-yawn`, which picks up the rebuilt package
  while the profile's other plugins stay:
  `kubectl -n dsh-yawn exec deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane -c control-plane -- rm /data/.dsh/profiles/web/.dsh-yawn-image-version`,
  then `kubectl -n dsh-yawn rollout restart deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane`.
- **Plugins disappeared after a control-plane upgrade:** the refresh failed, and
  the pod log says so. The manifest it was working from is kept at
  `/data/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json.before-reseed`, and the next boot
  merges it back in and retries. To recover by hand, copy that file over
  `package.json` in the profile and run `pnpm install` there.
- **The warm pool never becomes ready:** inspect agent-sandbox controller
  deployments, the `dsh-yawn-universal` `SandboxWarmPool`, and runner pod events.
- **The browser stops loading after a rollout:** restart the port-forward.
- **A browser tool call fails while direct runner health succeeds:** compare
  package resolution in the control-plane image as well as control-plane and runner logs;
  dsh plugins must share the control plane's in-box package instances.
- **Docker is unavailable:** report that the Docker, Kubernetes, and browser
  layers were not run. Unit tests do not substitute for those layers.
