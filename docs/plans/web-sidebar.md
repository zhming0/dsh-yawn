# Web sidebar against the sandbox

## Status

Slice one shipped; slice two deferred; slice three (the Terminal tab) shipped.
dsh 0.1.5-rc.1 added a right sidebar
to the Web surface, with a **Files** tab (workspace tree), a **Preview** tab
(Markdown, code, HTML, PDF, images, plain text), and file cards under each
assistant turn for files the model presents. The stock rows (`workspace-files`,
`ui-sidebar-files`, `ui-sidebar-documentpreview`, `ui-deliverables`) stay
mounted, and the bundle adds two rows of its own, described under "Slice one"
below, that run them against the session's sandbox. The reason to ship this
was the file cards: without them a presented image is a bare path in the chat,
and the sidebar's Preview tab is the one place in dsh that renders it.

Browsing wakes a hibernated sandbox and counts as idle-timer activity, like
any other request against the session. That was accepted deliberately: the
never-wake design in "Slice two" made the earlier implementation (commit
`0ec541d`, branch `sidebar/never-wake`, verified on Docker) three times the
size, and only usage can tell whether people leave a Files or Preview tab open
on idle sessions often enough to matter. Slice two stays recorded here so it
can be carried without rediscovering the facts it depends on.

## Why the stock rows fail

Every fact below was checked against the 0.1.5-rc.2 package sources.

- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-files` (`static inject = ["fs",
"sandboxPolicy", "sessions", "typert"]`) serves the browser over the RPC
  bridge. Each method takes a `workspaceFileScope` that the gateway resolves
  from the wire's session id into `{sessionId, workspaceRoot}`, where
  `workspaceRoot` is the session header `cwd`, and then calls `ctx.fs` with no
  agent context. Against the stock host filesystem that is fine.
- This bundle's `SandboxFileSystem` picks a runner per session through
  `ctx.agents.requireInitiator()`, which reads an `AsyncLocalStorage` that the
  agent loop sets around a turn and throws "no initiator" outside one. Model
  tool calls always run inside a turn, so `fs`, `shell`, and `subprocess` work
  unchanged; sidebar requests never do, so every list, read, and stat fails.
- `workspace-files` and `ui-deliverables` hard-inject `sandboxPolicy`, and dsh
  refuses to boot while a mounted row waits for a missing service. This
  bundle disables the stock `sandbox-policy` row because its prompt line names
  the host anchor cwd, so either both rows stay off or a stand-in must publish
  `sandboxPolicy`.
- The Web app serves a package's browser half (`dsh.client` in its
  `package.json`) only while a row of that package is mounted. The sidebar's
  file resource provider is the browser half of `workspace-files`, so
  disabling that row while leaving the tab rows mounted makes Preview report
  "The file resource service is unavailable"; the tab rows have to go with it.
  Conversely, replacing the row with a subclass under a different module name
  loses the browser half, and a patch entry's `name:` is an assertion that
  `dsh-app-boot` rejects with a warning when it differs from the stock module.
  The only way to change what the stock service does is to keep its row and
  wrap the live instance.
- `ui-sidebar-right` (the docking surface) must stay mounted regardless: the
  chat UI's browser half injects `sidebarRight`. With no tab rows it renders
  empty.
- Optional readers of `sandboxPolicy` do not force the stand-in: `tool-fs` and
  `tool-bash` call `ctx.get("sandboxPolicy")` only when a confining backend
  sets a default mode, and the sandbox backends do not. `dsh-terminal-bash`
  hard-injects it but is not mounted by the Web patch; the shipped `minimal`
  preset uses it, and with the stand-in it composes, and since the sandbox
  subprocess seam gained `spawnTerminal` (the runner's PTY RPC) its persistent
  terminal has the provider it waits on.

## Design

### Slice one: run the stock service as the session's agent

Shipped. Two host rows, both in the bundle's `insert:` list; the stock
`workspace-files` row stays mounted.

`sandbox-workspace-policy` (`provider/src/sandbox-policy.ts`) publishes
`sandboxPolicy` with the sandbox workspace as `workspaceRoot`, no per-session
mode override, and no prompt line. It exists only so the two Web rows can
compose.

`sandbox-workspace-files` (`provider/src/workspace-files.ts`) waits for
`workspaceFiles`, `agents`, and `sessionController` with `ctx.inject` rather
than `static inject`, so a headless profile without the Web-only services
still boots. It takes the live stock instance
(`Reflect.get(scope.workspaceFiles, symbols.original)`) and installs
own-property wrappers for `read`, `readBytes`, `readAll`, `readRelated`,
`stat`, `list`, and `changes`. Each wrapper resolves the scope's session to an
agent with `sessionController.resolveAgent(sessionId)` (live agent, or a
resumed stored session) and runs the stock method inside
`agents.withInitiator(agent, ...)`. The stock prototype methods and their
remote markers, which the gateway reads, are untouched, and disposing the row
removes the wrappers.

No path translation is needed: the scope's `workspaceRoot` is the session cwd
on the host, and `SandboxFileSystem.resolve` already maps the session cwd onto
the sandbox workspace for the agent it runs as, so every path the browser gets
back is a sandbox path. One cosmetic limit remains: the Files tab's header
label comes from the session `cwd` in the browser and shows the host anchor
directory.

In this slice a browse wakes a hibernated sandbox and counts as activity for
the idle timer, like any other request. `sandbox-manager` is untouched.

### Slice two: the sidebar never wakes a sandbox

Deferred. The browser lists the root whenever a Files tab opens, re-reads a
previewed file after every WebSocket reconnect, and re-opens its change feed
the same way, so none of that may decide when a sandbox runs. This slice is what made
the `sidebar/never-wake` implementation large (+707 lines across 10 files,
including `sandbox-manager` and `sandbox-lifecycle`). Only carry it if
wake-on-browse turns out to matter in practice.

- `SandboxLifecycle.runningClient(sessionId)`: under the session lock, returns
  the live runner only when the record state is `running` (cached attachment,
  else backend health check and reconnect without setup); never provisions,
  wakes, or recovers.
- `SandboxManager`: an `AsyncLocalStorage` flag set by `withoutWake(op)`, under
  which `clientForCurrentAgent()` answers only for a running sandbox and throws
  `SandboxNotRunningError` otherwise; `runningClient(agent)`; and
  `onceRunning(agent, signal)`, a waiter notified at the end of
  `ensureRunning`. Passive lookups do not re-arm the idle timer.
- `workspace-files` when the sandbox is not running: `list` answers from the
  file index saved at hibernation (the same index `@` uses, so `.git`,
  `node_modules`, and the other excluded names are missing and the entry cap
  applies); `read`, `readBytes`, `readAll`, `readRelated`, and `stat` throw
  `RemoteError("workspace-file/sandbox-hibernated", "The sandbox is
hibernated. Send a message to wake it.")`, which Preview shows with a Retry
  button; `changes` yields `{kind: "ready"}` at once so the browser can stat
  and learn the state, awaits `onceRunning`, then delegates to the stock feed
  dropping its own `ready`. With no index (host restarted while running, or
  the walk failed) `list` reports the hibernated error too.
- Stock browser behavior to know about: the first failed body read is sticky
  until Retry, even after the sandbox wakes; and only fs-tool writes emit
  `fs/observed` change frames, shell writes do not.

Verified on Docker: with the record `hibernated` and no runner container, the
Files tab listed from the index and Preview showed the hibernated message; a
prompt that edited the file woke the sandbox and the open preview reported the
change; Retry loaded it; with Preview left open the sandbox hibernated again on
its idle schedule.

### Slice three: the Terminal tab

Shipped. dsh 0.1.7 added a **Terminal** tab to the same sidebar
(`terminal-controller`, `ui-sidebar-terminal`); the upgrade that moved this
package to 0.1.7 kept it off because the sandbox subprocess seam had no
`spawnTerminal`. The seam now implements it over a bidirectional runner RPC
that owns a real PTY in the sandbox (a session leader with the PTY as its
controlling terminal), so input, resize, foreground and activity queries, and
signals go one way while output and the exit status come back the other. The
bundle adds one more row, `sandbox-terminal-controller`, using the slice-one
recipe on the stock controller: `shells` and `create` run inside
`agents.withInitiator(agent, ...)`, so opening a terminal wakes a hibernated
sandbox, and `write`/`resize` call `SandboxManager.noteActivity` so the idle
timer does not hibernate a sandbox out from under an open terminal. Screen
buffers, reconnection, shell selection, and tab lifetime stay in the stock
host controller and browser half. Unlike a file browse, a keystroke alone
neither wakes nor provisions: if the sandbox is gone its terminal is too, and
the stock controller marks it failed.

## Open question

Whether slice two is needed at all. Wake-on-browse shipped as acceptable; the
answer depends on how often people leave a Files or Preview tab open on an
idle session, and only usage decides it.
