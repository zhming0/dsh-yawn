# Runner on Kubernetes agent-sandbox

This backend runs each session in a Kubernetes pod managed by
[agent-sandbox](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox). A warm pool
is a set of pre-started pods, so a new session usually claims one instead of
waiting for a cold start. The control plane creates a `SandboxClaim` per
session, the runner in the pod connects back to the control plane's tunnel, and
nothing connects in.

This is the supported backend. It is pinned to agent-sandbox **v1.0.2**
(`agents.x-k8s.io/v1beta1` and `extensions.agents.x-k8s.io/v1beta1`). Do not
assume these manifests work with another release.

Install the [control plane](installations-control-plane.md) first. For how the
pieces fit together and the isolation model, see
[`kubernetes.md`](kubernetes.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Agent-sandbox controllers v1.0.2**, installed below. A Helm chart cannot
  own another project's CRDs, so this is a manual step.
- **The pool must be in the control-plane release namespace.** Its template
  reads the `dsh-yawn-runner-config` ConfigMap and the
  `dsh-yawn-registration-token` Secret from that namespace, and the control
  plane's Role and tunnel Service live there. The chart also requires every
  Kubernetes profile to target that namespace.
- **Nodes that allow a privileged container.** Each sandbox runs a rootless
  Docker daemon sidecar so sessions can build images. To drop it, delete the
  `docker` container and its two `emptyDir` volumes from the template and the
  runner's `DOCKER_HOST` entry. The Docker CLI then reports that no daemon is
  reachable. [`kubernetes.md`](kubernetes.md#docker-inside-a-sandbox) explains
  why the sidecar is privileged.

## Install the controllers

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/releases/download/v1.0.2/sandbox-with-extensions.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=Established \
  crd/sandboxes.agents.x-k8s.io \
  crd/sandboxclaims.extensions.agents.x-k8s.io \
  crd/sandboxtemplates.extensions.agents.x-k8s.io \
  crd/sandboxwarmpools.extensions.agents.x-k8s.io --timeout=120s
kubectl -n agent-sandbox-system wait --for=condition=Available deployment --all --timeout=180s
```

If you are upgrading from v0.5.x, follow the
[agent-sandbox migration guide](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/agent-sandbox/blob/v1.0.2/docs/api-migration-guide.md)
first.

## Apply the sandbox pool

The checked-in base names no namespace, so applying it directly fails. Write an
overlay that sets the namespace and pins the runner image to the same release
as the control plane. Use one concrete version in both `<release-tag>`
placeholders.

```yaml
# dsh-yawn-runner/kustomization.yaml
namespace: dsh-yawn
resources:
  - https://github.com/zhming0/dsh-yawn//deploy/kubernetes/runner?ref=<release-tag>
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-runner
    newTag: <release-tag>
```

From a checkout, point `resources` at `../deploy/kubernetes/runner` instead of
the remote base. Then apply it:

```sh
kubectl apply -k dsh-yawn-runner

kubectl -n dsh-yawn wait --for=jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'=1 \
  sandboxwarmpool/dsh-yawn-universal --timeout=300s
```

The base contains a `SandboxTemplate` describing the sandbox pod, a
`SandboxWarmPool` keeping pods warm, and nothing else. It reads the control
plane's URL and registration token from what the chart wrote, so the namespace
is the only cluster-specific value.

## Configure the pool

Change a pool with a JSON patch in your overlay. Address lists as a whole
rather than by index: Kubernetes treats a custom resource list as one value,
and a new release may reorder entries.

```yaml
patches:
  - target: { kind: SandboxWarmPool, name: dsh-yawn-universal }
    patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /spec/replicas
        value: 4
  - target: { kind: SandboxTemplate, name: dsh-yawn-universal }
    patch: |-
      - op: replace
        path: /spec/volumeClaimTemplates
        value:
          - metadata:
              name: workspace
            spec:
              accessModes: [ReadWriteOnce]
              storageClassName: rook-ceph-block
              resources:
                requests:
                  storage: 10Gi
      - op: add
        path: /spec/podTemplate/spec/resources
        value:
          requests: {cpu: 200m, memory: 512Mi}
          limits: {cpu: "4", memory: 6Gi}
```

The checked-in network policy allows the tunnel to the control plane (TCP
8081), DNS (TCP/UDP 53), and HTTP/HTTPS (80 and 443). Narrow the 80/443 rule in
production. The runner's Docker data `emptyDir` is patched the same way, as a
whole list under `/spec/podTemplate/spec/volumes`. See
[`kubernetes.md`](kubernetes.md#connectivity-and-isolation) for the security
model and more patch recipes.

## Point the control plane at the pool

```yaml
# dsh-yawn.values.yaml
controlPlane:
  sandboxManager:
    profiles:
      standard:
        backend: kas
        warmPool: dsh-yawn-universal
```

```sh
helm upgrade dsh-yawn-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/zhming0/charts/dsh-yawn \
  --namespace dsh-yawn \
  --values dsh-yawn.values.yaml
```

The chart mounts these values at `/etc/dsh-yawn/sandbox-settings.yaml`, and the
Web UI's **Settings → Sandboxes** page layers its own profiles and changes over
them. A values change rolls the control plane pod. Profiles defined in values
are locked in the page. A `kas` profile that omits `namespace` uses the release
namespace, which is where the pool and the control plane's Role live.

Now run a session and send a prompt: a warm pod is claimed, the repository is
cloned into it, and tools run there.

## Several pools

A second pool needs a second template and warm-pool pair, plus a second
profile. Copy the two YAML files in
[`deploy/kubernetes/runner`](../deploy/kubernetes/runner) under a new name,
change the container resources and the volume request, add them to your
kustomization, and list both profiles:

```yaml
- id: sandbox-manager
  config:
    defaultProfile: standard
    profiles:
      standard:
        backend: kas
        warmPool: dsh-yawn-universal
      large:
        backend: kas
        warmPool: dsh-large
```

The same approach works for a structurally different pool: gVisor, custom
tolerations, or a different security context. A session can only pick from the
pools the cluster operator publishes.

## Next

[`credentials.md`](credentials.md) gives sessions their credentials, starting
with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
