# Control plane

The control plane is the dsh process, its data volume, and the runner tunnel.
It runs on Kubernetes through the Helm chart, or on a VM with Docker. Sandboxes
run elsewhere; see the [installation index](installations.md).

## Kubernetes

The `dsh-yawn` Helm chart installs the control plane and the Kubernetes
permissions it needs to manage sandboxes.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster you administer, with `kubectl` 1.27 or later.
- `helm` 3.8 or later.
- A default StorageClass, or a storage class name for the control plane's data
  volume.
- A sign-in method: the built-in passcode login (`auth.mode=passcode`), or an
  OIDC identity provider (`auth.mode=oidc`).

### Install

The examples use namespace `dsh-yawn`. One namespace holds one control plane,
and the release must be named `dsh-yawn-control-plane`: the Kubernetes runner
manifests read fixed names that this release owns.

For the built-in passcode login, set a passcode of at least 8 characters in
your values. The chart stores it in a Secret it owns; `auth.existingSecret`
keeps it in one you manage instead:

```yaml
# dsh-yawn.values.yaml
auth:
  passcode: choose-a-long-passphrase
  hostname: dsh.example.com
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

`auth.hostname` is the name users open; the chart hands it to dsh as
`--trusted-host`. For an Ingress or a Gateway API route, point it at the
Service and use the same name.

For OIDC instead, set the issuer, client, allowed accounts, and public
hostname. The redirect URL defaults to
`https://<auth.hostname>/oidc/callback`; register it at the issuer, or set
`auth.oidc.redirectUrl` explicitly. The issuer may live on any site, including
one on a different registrable domain than `auth.hostname`; when it does, the
callback briefly shows a "Signing in" page that reloads the same URL from this
origin, because the identity provider's redirect is a cross-site navigation
that dsh's request fence refuses.

```yaml
# dsh-yawn.values.yaml
auth:
  mode: oidc
  hostname: dsh.example.com
  oidc:
    issuer: https://idp.example/realms/acme
    clientId: dsh-yawn-control-plane
    clientSecret: …
    allowedDomains: [your-company.com]
    # Default true: accept email_verified: false or a missing claim.
    # Set false to require email_verified: true.
    allowUnverifiedEmail: true
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

```sh
helm install dsh-yawn-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/zhming0/charts/dsh-yawn \
  --namespace dsh-yawn \
  --values dsh-yawn.values.yaml
```

The chart also creates the ServiceAccount, Role, and RoleBinding the Kubernetes
backend uses: `sandboxclaims`, `sandboxes`, and the
`dsh-yawn-registration-token` Secret the control plane keeps current.
Kubernetes cannot limit `create` to one Secret name, so the Role can create any
Secret in the namespace; `patch` is limited to that one Secret.

### Expose the Web UI

The chart's Service is a ClusterIP anchor by default. Either set
`service.type=LoadBalancer`, as above, or point your own Ingress or Gateway API
route at it. Whatever fronts dsh must serve HTTPS — the passcode and the
session cookie cross it — and must pass WebSockets and large request bodies.
With ingress-nginx:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dsh-yawn-control-plane
  namespace: dsh-yawn
  annotations:
    # The Web UI holds WebSockets open at /api/events.* and can carry large
    # attachments; nginx's defaults are too small.
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "3600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 300m
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: dsh.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: dsh-yawn-control-plane
                port:
                  name: http
          # Only for runners outside the cluster, such as Buildkite agents.
          # It skips sign-in: the registration token protects the tunnel.
          - path: /tunnel
            pathType: Exact
            backend:
              service:
                name: dsh-yawn-control-plane-tunnel
                port:
                  name: tunnel
  tls:
    - hosts: [dsh.example.com]
      secretName: dsh-yawn-tls
```

The host must match `auth.hostname`. The chart passes it to dsh as
`--trusted-host`, because dsh rejects `/api` requests whose `Host` header is
neither loopback nor trusted.

With the passcode login, users open `https://dsh.example.com/` and enter the
passcode. With OIDC, the same URL redirects to the issuer and back. Everyone
you allow shares the same sessions, secrets, and sandboxes, so keep
`auth.oidc.allowedEmails` or `auth.oidc.allowedDomains` narrow.

To use only `kubectl port-forward`, keep `service.type: ClusterIP`, then:

```sh
kubectl -n dsh-yawn port-forward deploy/dsh-yawn-control-plane 3000:3000
# open http://localhost:3000/ and enter the passcode
```

OIDC needs the hostname you configured: its redirect URL is
`https://<auth.hostname>/oidc/callback`, so a bare port-forward does not match
it. Point an Ingress or Gateway at the Service instead, or set a matching
`auth.oidc.redirectUrl` for a local forward.

### Verify

```sh
kubectl -n dsh-yawn rollout status deployment/dsh-yawn-control-plane --timeout=300s
```

The pod becomes Ready when dsh is serving; the probe uses `/healthz` and does
not depend on the identity provider. Open the address you exposed; the
passcode form or the OIDC redirect appears at `/login`. You can then create a
session, add secrets, and add a repository workspace. The first tool call fails
until a runner is installed, which is expected.

### Upgrade

`helm upgrade` moves the control plane. It does not change runners; re-apply
their manifests at the matching version to move their image.

The old `oidc.enabled`/`oidc.*` values and `controlPlane.launchToken` were
removed. The chart fails if either is still present rather than silently
changing the sign-in mode. Move OIDC settings under `auth.oidc` and set
`auth.mode: oidc`.

The data volume carries the dsh profile across the upgrade. On the first boot
of a new image, the image's seed refreshes the control plane's own package and
keeps everything else in the profile, including plugins installed from the Web
UI. If that refresh fails, the seed logs a warning, keeps the previous
`package.json` as `package.json.before-reseed`, and retries on the next boot.

## VM or other Docker host

The same control-plane image runs as one Docker container on any machine you
keep on. Sandboxes then run as sibling containers on that machine's Docker, or
on Buildkite. The image serves the same passcode or OIDC sign-in; bring an
HTTPS proxy for the network path, not an authentication layer.

### Run the container

```sh
export DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE="$(openssl rand -base64 18)"
printf 'passcode: %s\n' "$DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE"

docker run -d --name dsh-yawn --restart unless-stopped \
  --network host \
  -e DSH_YAWN_PASSCODE \
  -v dsh-yawn-data:/data \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-control-plane:<version> \
  --trusted-host dsh.example.com
```

This differs from the [README's quick start](../README.md#quick-start) on
purpose:

- `--network host` without `DSH_YAWN_BIND_ALL` keeps the Web UI on the VM's
  loopback, `127.0.0.1:3000`. Sandbox containers cannot reach it, so only your
  proxy can serve the passcode form. On a Docker network the quick start's way,
  a sandbox can reach port 3000, but the passcode gate is what protects it.
- The runner tunnel listens on port 8081 on every interface, so sandboxes on
  this machine can dial it. Keep it off the internet with a firewall.
- `--trusted-host` names the hostname users open. dsh rejects `/api` requests
  whose `Host` header is neither loopback nor trusted.
- The `dsh-yawn-data` volume holds the profile, sessions, and credentials.

### Authentication

The passcode is the sign-in. Put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front, such as Caddy
or nginx; it only terminates TLS. Run it on the VM itself, or in a container
with `--network host`, so it can reach loopback. It must:

- serve HTTPS and proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`, passing the `Host` header
  through;
- pass WebSockets, keep connections open for hours, and accept request bodies
  of a few hundred megabytes.

Users then open `https://dsh.example.com/` and enter the passcode.

For OIDC on this path, set the same `DSH_YAWN_OIDC_*` variables the chart sets
(`ISSUER`, `CLIENT_ID`, `REDIRECT_URL`, `ALLOWED_EMAILS` or
`ALLOWED_DOMAINS`, and optionally `CLIENT_SECRET`, `SCOPE`, and
`ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_EMAIL`). `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_EMAIL` defaults to true; set it to
`false` to require `email_verified: true`. The redirect URL must be the public
`https://dsh.example.com/oidc/callback`.

For runners outside this machine, such as Buildkite agents, also route the
exact path `/tunnel` to port 8081 and leave authentication off that path: the
registration token already protects it. Runners then dial
`wss://dsh.example.com/tunnel`. See
[Tunnel](../control-plane/README.md#tunnel).

### Upgrade

Pull the new version, remove the container, and run the same command with the
new tag. The data volume keeps the profile and installed plugins, as on
Kubernetes.
