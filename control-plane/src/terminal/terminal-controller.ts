/**
 * Runs dsh's Web terminal controller against the session's sandbox.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-terminal-controller` serves the right sidebar's
 * Terminal tab. Each of its typed Remote methods receives the session owner
 * (`agent`) that the gateway resolved from the wire, and drives the terminal
 * through `ctx.subprocess.spawnTerminal` — which this package implements over
 * the runner's PTY RPC. This bundle's subprocess seam finds a session's
 * sandbox through the agent that is asking (`ctx.agents.requireInitiator()`),
 * the same way `fs`, `shell`, and the one-shot spawn path do, and browser
 * requests arrive outside any agent turn. Without a boundary, opening a
 * terminal fails with "no initiator" exactly as the sidebar's file browser
 * did.
 *
 * The wire already carries the session: every method that reaches the seam
 * takes the resolved Agent first. This module keeps the stock row mounted and
 * wraps the live instance's methods so those calls run inside
 * `agents.withInitiator(agent, ...)`. A request then reaches the sandbox the
 * way a tool call does: a hibernated sandbox wakes, and the allocation counts
 * as activity for the idle timer. Input and resize additionally reset that
 * timer, so a sandbox is not hibernated out from under a terminal someone is
 * typing in. Nothing starts or wakes on a keystroke: if the sandbox is gone,
 * its terminal is too, and the stock controller marks it failed.
 *
 * The stock row has to stay mounted, under its own name, because its browser
 * half comes with it: the Web app serves a package's client bundle only for a
 * mounted row of that package, and the sidebar's terminal provider lives in
 * that bundle. Replacing the row with a subclass would leave the tab without
 * it. The wrappers are own properties on the service instance, so the stock
 * prototype methods and their remote markers, which the gateway reads, are
 * untouched; disposing the row removes them.
 *
