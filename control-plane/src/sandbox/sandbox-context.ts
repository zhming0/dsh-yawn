/**
 * Sandbox truth for the model-facing system prompt.
 *
 * Sandboxed sessions work entirely in sandbox paths, but dsh's prompt
 * variables describe the host: `cwd` is a bookkeeping anchor that does not
 * exist inside the sandbox. This module:
 *
 * 1. shadows the `cwd` prompt variable with the sandbox workspace, so any
 *    prompt text that renders it names a path the model's tools actually
 *    resolve (dsh's own "Current working directory" line does not use the
 *    variable; `working-directory.ts` keeps that one in sandbox paths); and
 * 2. contributes a short environment section stating where tools run.
 *
 * dsh's host-only prompt text — the implementation checkout and the Web GUI
 * URL — comes from its `harness-dev-context` row, which the bundle patch
 * disables, so there is nothing here to remove.
 *
 * @module @zhming0/dsh-yawn/sandbox-context
