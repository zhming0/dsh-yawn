/**
 * Resolve the top-level session whose sandbox serves one agent's file and
 * command work.
 *
 * Subagent sessions share their root session's sandbox, so every sandbox
 * lookup keys on the root. The child session header carries the durable
 * `parentSession` lineage, and in-process children resolve each ancestor
 * through the live agent registry. A link that cannot be resolved — an
 * absent or disposed ancestor — degrades to the agent itself, which is the
 * per-session sandbox this control plane shipped before root keying.
 *
 * Only a real subagent child shares a sandbox. dsh records `parentSession`
 * for any session cut from another session's log, so a Fork child carries
 * its source in the same field; the `origin` marker separates the two. A
 * fork is a top-level session that owns a fresh working copy, so following
 * its lineage would hand it the source's sandbox — waking a hibernated
 * source and letting both sessions write one copy.
 *
 * `origin` is load-bearing here even though dsh calls it "presentation
 * metadata, not proof" in its `SessionHeader` docs: sandbox identity depends
 * on it, so it is a compatibility risk, not a display detail. If dsh renames
 * the field, drops it, or marks subagent children another way, this check
 * stops matching and every child — including forks — resolves to itself.
 * Broadening who shares a sandbox needs its own evidence; the current default
 * gives each unseen child its own, which is correct for a fork and a lost
 * shared working copy for delegation. Read the pinned package's
 * `SessionHeader` before changing this, and keep the fork case in
 * `root-session.test.ts` passing.
