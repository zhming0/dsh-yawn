/**
 * The sandbox manager, composed by role with dependencies flowing one way:
 * the facade (sandbox-manager.ts) and policies (idle.ts, profile-choice.ts)
 * call the lifecycle engine (sandbox-lifecycle.ts), which calls leaf services
 * (runner-attachment.ts, profile-registry.ts, the stores). Features plug into
 * engine-defined seams through LifecycleHooks (workspaces/file-index-hooks.ts,
 * sandbox-notices.ts) instead of being called by name. This file only
 * re-exports the public surface.
