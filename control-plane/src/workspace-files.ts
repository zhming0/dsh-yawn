/**
 * Runs dsh's Web file browser (`workspaceFiles`) as the session it serves.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-files` serves the Files and Preview sidebar
 * tabs and the deliverables cards: it lists directories and reads files
 * through `ctx.fs`, rooted at the session cwd. Those calls arrive from the
 * browser, outside any agent turn. This package's filesystem finds a session's
 * sandbox through the agent that is asking (`ctx.agents.requireInitiator()`),
 * so the stock service run as-is fails with "no initiator" on every request.
 *
 * The wire already names the session: every method takes a
 * `workspaceFileScope` that the gateway resolves from the request's session
 * id. This module keeps the stock row mounted and wraps its methods on the
 * live service so each one runs as that session's agent. The agent comes from
 * `sessionController.resolveAgent`, which returns the live agent or resumes a
 * stored session. A request then reaches the sandbox the way a tool call
 * does: a hibernated sandbox wakes, and the read counts as activity for the
 * idle timer. docs/plans/web-sidebar.md records the never-wake design that
 * would change that, should browsing turn out to keep sandboxes up.
 *
 * The stock row has to stay mounted, and under its own name, because its
 * browser half comes with it: the Web app serves a package's client bundle
 * only for a mounted row of that package, and the sidebar's file resource
 * provider lives in that bundle. Replacing the row with a subclass would leave
 * the sidebar without it. The wrappers are own properties on the service
 * instance, so the stock prototype methods and their remote markers, which
 * the gateway reads, are untouched; disposing the row removes them.
 *
 * Path translation needs no changes here: the scope's `workspaceRoot` is the
 * session cwd on the host, and `SandboxFileSystem.resolve` already maps the
 * session cwd onto the sandbox workspace for the agent it runs as. Every path
 * the browser gets back is a sandbox path.
