# dsh-yawn Helm chart

Installs the dsh-yawn **control plane**: one control plane, its data volume,
the tunnel Service runners dial, the shared registration token, and the
identity and permissions the control plane uses to operate Kubernetes sandboxes.

This chart does not install sandboxes. Setting a runner up is a second phase:
[installations-control-plane.md](../../../docs/installations-control-plane.md)
covers this install, then
[docs/installations.md](../../../docs/installations.md) points to
[installations-kas.md](../../../docs/installations-kas.md) for the Kubernetes
sandbox pool in [`deploy/kubernetes/runner`](../../kubernetes/runner), or
[installations-buildkite.md](../../../docs/installations-buildkite.md) for
Buildkite agents.

Installing this chart alone gives you a working control plane: the Web UI, sessions,
secrets, instructions, and repository workspaces all work. The first tool call
in a session needs a sandbox, so it fails with a message naming the missing
runner until a runner is set up and the control plane points at it.

## Previews

Set `preview.domain` to serve each sandbox's HTTP servers at their own origin,
`<sandboxId>-p<port>.<domain>`:

```sh
helm upgrade dsh-yawn-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/zhming0/charts/dsh-yawn \
  --namespace dsh-yawn --reuse-values \
  --set preview.domain=sandbox.example.com
```

The chart creates the `dsh-yawn-control-plane-preview` Service and nothing in
front of it. You provide the wildcard DNS record, the wildcard certificate
(DNS-01), the Ingress rule for `*.<domain>`, and the authentication: the
listener answers every request that reaches it. If that authentication uses a
cookie, list its name in `preview.authCookieNames` so the control plane strips
it before a request enters a sandbox. The copy-paste forms and the cookie
rules are in [docs/kubernetes.md](../../../docs/kubernetes.md).

## Prerequisites

- a Kubernetes cluster and an OIDC identity provider, unless you reach the
  control plane over `kubectl port-forward`
- a default StorageClass for the control plane data volume, or `controlPlane.persistence.storageClass`

## Install

```sh
helm install dsh-yawn-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/zhming0/charts/dsh-yawn \
  --namespace dsh-yawn --create-namespace \
  --set oidc.enabled=true \
  --set oidc.hostname=dsh.example.com \
  --set service.type=LoadBalancer
```

The release must be named `dsh-yawn-control-plane` and live in one namespace per control plane:
the pool's manifests read the fixed names `dsh-yawn-control-plane-tunnel`, `dsh-yawn-runner-config`,
and `dsh-yawn-registration-token`, which this release owns.

Create the proxy's OIDC Secret first — NOTES.txt has the command; until it
exists the pod runs but never becomes Ready. Without `oidc.enabled`, reach the
control plane over `kubectl port-forward` and open `/launch-token`.

## Values

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `controlPlane.image.repository` | `ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-control-plane` | Host image |
| `controlPlane.image.tag` | `.Chart.appVersion` | Released tag |
| `controlPlane.resources` | `250m/512Mi → 2Gi` | Host container resources |
| `controlPlane.extraArgs` | `[]` | Extra dsh web app arguments |
| `controlPlane.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra control-plane env vars, for a credential it needs itself (`BUILDKITE_API_TOKEN`, say) from a Secret you own; never a sandbox secret |
| `controlPlane.podAnnotations` / `controlPlane.podLabels` | `{}` | Extra pod metadata |
| `controlPlane.persistence.enabled` | `true` | `false` swaps the data PVC for an emptyDir — every restart then loses sessions and the credentials store, silently |
| `controlPlane.persistence.size` | `5Gi` | Host data volume size |
| `controlPlane.persistence.storageClass` | `""` | Host data volume StorageClass; required when the cluster has no default |
| `runner.controlPlaneUrl` | `ws://dsh-yawn-control-plane-tunnel.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:8081/tunnel` | Tunnel address written into `dsh-yawn-runner-config`; set only for an unusual layout |
| `registrationToken.existingSecret` | `""` | Existing Secret with the shared token under key `token`; no Secret is created |
| `registrationToken.value` | `""` | Fixed token; a stable random one is generated when empty |
| `oidc.enabled` | `false` | Add the oauth2-proxy sidecar, `--trusted-host`, and the proxy Service |
| `oidc.hostname` | `""` | Required when enabled: bare host, no scheme |
| `oidc.image` | `quay.io/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy:v7.15.4` | Proxy image |
| `oidc.existingSecret` | `dsh-yawn-oidc` | Secret with the proxy's OIDC and cookie configuration |
| `oidc.emailDomains` | `*` | `OAUTH2_PROXY_EMAIL_DOMAINS` — restrict before trusting an issuer's whole user base |
| `oidc.extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra env vars for the proxy, appended after the fixed ones |
| `service.type` | `ClusterIP` | Exposure type for the proxy Service |
| `service.port` | `80` | Service port in front of the proxy's 4180 |
| `service.annotations` | `{}` | Cloud/controller annotations for the Service |
| `controlPlane.sandboxManager` | `{}` | The deployment base of the control plane's sandbox-manager settings; unset seeds no profile, so no sandbox can be provisioned |

## Sandbox-manager settings as values

`controlPlane.sandboxManager` is the deployment base of the control plane's
sandbox-manager settings on a chart install. The chart renders the runtime
slice — profiles, `defaultProfile`, `idleMs`, and `expiresAfterMs` — into the
document's top-level `sandboxManager` section, as one ordinary file mounted at
`/etc/dsh-yawn/sandbox-settings.yaml`. The control plane resolves the
settings-form edits in the profile patch over that section. So:

- a values change applies when `helm upgrade` rolls the pod (the chart stamps
  the rendered values into a pod annotation), not live;
- **Settings → Sandboxes** in the Web UI adds its own profiles and changes the
  default profile and timers without a restart, and a reset returns them to
  what the chart configures. The profiles the chart defines are locked there:
  the page shows them as deployment and cannot edit or remove them;
- a `kas` profile that names no namespace is rendered with the release
  namespace, because the control plane's own default is the fixed name
  `dsh-yawn`;
- the section layout is the chart-to-image contract, and the image tag can lag
  the chart's, so a section this version does not know is ignored. It is not a
  general settings layer for other dsh plugins;
- the section is otherwise rendered verbatim — the control plane's own validation is
  the schema. The chart guard requires at least one profile, rejects startup
  settings in these values, and requires every `kas` profile to target the
  release namespace, where the control plane's Role and the tunnel Service
  live.

For a Kubernetes pool, name it in the profile:

```sh
helm upgrade dsh-yawn-control-plane oci://ghcr.io/zhming0/charts/dsh-yawn \
  --namespace dsh-yawn \
  --reuse-values \
  --set controlPlane.sandboxManager.profiles.standard.backend=kas \
  --set controlPlane.sandboxManager.profiles.standard.warmPool=dsh-yawn-universal
```

See [control-plane settings](../../../control-plane/README.md#settings) for the
settings reference. Startup settings are not part of these values; set them in
the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`.

## Notes

- The data PVC carries `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, so `helm uninstall`
  leaves sessions, credentials, and the seeded profile on the volume.
- The registration token Secret is generated once per release and reused on
  upgrades; rotating it follows
  [docs/kubernetes.md](../../../docs/kubernetes.md#the-in-cluster-control-plane).
- **GitOps (Argo CD, Flux):** those renderers have no live cluster, so the
  lookup that keeps the generated token stable cannot find the existing Secret
  and every sync invents a new one — the release never converges and the token
  rotates under the warm pods. Set `registrationToken.value` from your secret
  store, or `registrationToken.existingSecret`.
- The chart deliberately ships no Ingress: the proxy Service is the anchor.
  Whatever fronts dsh must serve https, pass WebSockets, and allow large RPC
  bodies — [docs/kubernetes.md](../../../docs/kubernetes.md) has the
  nginx-ingress reference values.
