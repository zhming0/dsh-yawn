# dsh-yawn-runner

`dsh-yawn-runner` is the in-sandbox ConnectRPC server. It dials the control plane rather
than accepting inbound connections: `DSH_YAWN_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` names its tunnel
endpoint as a WebSocket URL (`ws://host:port/tunnel`, or `wss://host/tunnel`
through an HTTPS proxy that terminates TLS in front of the control plane), and the
runner registers with `DSH_YAWN_SANDBOX_ID` plus the shared secret in
`DSH_YAWN_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` (or a file named by
`DSH_YAWN_REGISTRATION_TOKEN_FILE`), sent as a bearer token and the
`X-Dsh-Yawn-Sandbox-Id` header on the upgrade request.
After a registration is accepted, the runner serves its RPCs over that same
WebSocket with HTTP/2 roles reversed, and redials with backoff whenever the
tunnel drops. RPCs are reachable only over tunnels the runner itself opened.
`wss://` certificates are checked against the system CA bundle; point
`SSL_CERT_FILE` at a private CA if the proxy uses one.

Secrets and Git credentials exist only in process memory. Child processes get a
small allowlisted base environment, the current secrets, and RPC-supplied
overrides; they do not inherit the runner environment. Git obtains credentials
from a mode-0600 Unix socket at `CREDENTIAL_SOCKET` (default
`/run/dsh/credentials.sock`) through `dsh-yawn-runner git-credential`.

Setup defaults to `/workspace/repository`, preserves an already initialized
workspace, and runs the repository's `.agents/setup` hook once per machine. The
completion marker is `/var/lib/dsh-yawn/setup-done`, on the machine's own
filesystem and not on the workspace volume, so a rebuilt machine runs setup
again while a machine that stayed alive does not. The entry in `Setup`'s
response means a setup run happened on this call; a machine that already ran it
answers `false`. A setup hook runs on a checkout that may already carry an
earlier run's output — possibly with a session's uncommitted work — so it must
be safe to re-run. Setup creates the apt cache directory
`/workspace/.dsh-yawn/apt-cache`, which the image's apt configuration names, so
system packages a setup installs are downloaded once per workspace volume;
after a successful setup it trims that cache with `apt-get autoclean` and
clears it past 2 GiB.

Keeping the checkout beneath the persistent volume root prevents filesystem metadata
such as `lost+found` from entering the repository. The file APIs operate with
the container user's permissions; they are not a filesystem sandbox. Run the
image as its non-root `sandbox` user (UID/GID 1000) and isolate its
filesystem/network at the container platform boundary. The image leaves `USER`
unset for Buildkite hosted agents, so a plain `docker run` defaults to root.
The Docker backend and documented Buildkite command pass `--user 1000:1000`;
the Kubernetes template sets the identity through its security context.

The home directory is `/workspace/home`, also on the workspace volume, so
package caches, tool configuration, and anything installed under `$HOME`
survive hibernation. The runner creates the directory at startup because a
Kubernetes sandbox mounts its workspace volume over `/workspace` and hides the
image's copy. Files outside `/workspace`, `/tmp` among them, do not survive a
wake.

Global installs need no root: `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` sends `npm install -g` to
`$HOME/.local`, `uv tool install` uses `$HOME/.local/bin`, and mise keeps its
default data directory at `$HOME/.local/share/mise`. A `/etc/profile.d` script
puts those directories back on `PATH` for login shells, which Debian's
`/etc/profile` would otherwise reset.

The `sandbox` user has passwordless sudo (`/etc/sudoers.d/90-sandbox`), so a
repository whose own setup installs system packages, as `mise bootstrap
packages apply` does for an `apt:` entry, needs no custom image. The
Kubernetes template allows privilege escalation for that. What apt installs
still lives outside `$HOME`, so it goes away with the machine — but the
workspace volume carries the downloaded `.deb` files, and the machine that
replaces it runs setup again, so the same packages come back without a second
download. Files under `$HOME`, the workspace volume, are the ones that survive
by themselves.

`GET /health` on `ADDR` (default `:8080`) is an unauthenticated
process-readiness probe for the kubelet; it is the only listener the runner
opens and does not expose sandbox data or RPCs.

The reference Dockerfile builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. It includes
Git, GitHub CLI, Jujutsu, mise, ripgrep, Python with uv, Node.js,
Corepack-backed pnpm and Yarn, a native build toolchain, common archive and
process utilities, jq, yq, and the Docker CLI with Buildx and Compose. It
deliberately excludes pip, the Docker daemon, and the container runtime;
platforms that want Docker commands to reach a daemon must provide one
separately. Architecture-specific archives have pinned checksums, and the Go
stage cross-compiles from the builder's own architecture rather than running
the toolchain under emulation.

It also installs the `agent-browser` CLI and `install-browser`, the bootstrap
the `using-agent-browser` skill runs. The browser itself is deliberately
absent, and so are the libraries and the font it needs to draw: together they
are far larger than everything else here, and a task drives a page rarely
enough that paying for them on every pull is the wrong trade. `install-browser`
adds them to a session on first use, into the workspace volume so a
hibernation keeps them.

The CLI sits in `/opt/agent-browser` and is linked onto `PATH`, outside both
`$HOME` and `/workspace`, because a session mounts its workspace volume over
`/workspace` and would otherwise hide it.

Releases are published to `ghcr.io/zhming0/dsh-yawn-runner`, tagged with the same
version as the `@zhming0/dsh-yawn` package that expects them.

When standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*`, `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER`, or
`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER` settings are present, the runner exports HTTP traces and
command-duration metrics. With no exporter settings, telemetry stays local and
the runner does not try to contact a collector.
