# Install Chrome for Testing, the libraries it links against, and a font, into
# a sandbox on demand.
#
# The runner image carries this script and the `agent-browser` CLI but not the
# browser: Chrome and its dependencies are far larger than the rest of the
# image put together, and a sandbox needs them only when a task actually drives
# a page. This pays that cost once per sandbox, into the workspace volume so a
# hibernation keeps it.
#
# It does not use the sandbox's sudo. The libraries have to live under $HOME to
# survive a wake, and `apt-get` would put them in the container filesystem
# instead, so the packages are fetched with a user-owned apt state, unpacked
# into a private directory, and reached through LD_LIBRARY_PATH. apt resolves
# whatever they pull in; the list is a starting point, not a hand-maintained
# inventory.
#
# The font is not optional: a slim Debian ships none, and without one Chrome
# draws no text at all, so a page renders blank and the browser can exit on its
# first navigation.
#
# Usage:  install-browser
# Then:   . "$HOME/.local/share/agent-browser-env.sh"
#
# Re-running is cheap and safe: an existing browser and library tree are left
# alone unless AGENT_BROWSER_REINSTALL=1 is set.
